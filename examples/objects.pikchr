# First row of objects
box "box"
box rad 10px "box (with" "rounded" "corners)" at 1in right of previous
circle "circle" at 1in right of previous
ellipse "ellipse" at 1in right of previous

# second row of objects
OVAL1: oval "oval" at 1in below first box
oval "(tall &amp;" "thin)" "oval" width OVAL1.height height OVAL1.width \
    at 1in right of previous
cylinder "cylinder" at 1in right of previous
file "file" at 1in right of previous

# third row shows line-type objects
dot "dot" above at 1in below first oval
line right from 1.8cm right of previous "lines" above
arrow right from 1.8cm right of previous "arrows" above
spline from 1.8cm right of previous \
   go right .15 then .3 heading 30 then .5 heading 160 then .4 heading 20 \
   then right .15
"splines" at 3rd vertex of previous

# The third vertex of the spline is not actually on the drawn
# curve.  The third vertex is a control point.  To see its actual
# position, uncomment the following line:
#dot color red at 3rd vertex of previous spline

# Draw various lines below the first line
line dashed right from 0.3cm below start of previous line
line dotted right from 0.3cm below start of previous
line thin   right from 0.3cm below start of previous
line thick  right from 0.3cm below start of previous


# Draw arrows with different arrowhead configurations below
# the first arrow
arrow <-  right from 0.4cm below start of previous arrow
arrow <-> right from 0.4cm below start of previous

# Draw splines with different arrowhead configurations below
# the first spline
spline same from .4cm below start of first spline ->
spline same from .4cm below start of previous <-
spline same from .4cm below start of previous <->
